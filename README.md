# ecmwf-opendata

`ecmwf-opendata` is a package to simplify the download of ECMWF [open data](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/open-data). It implements a request-based interface to the dataset using ECMWF's MARS language to select meteorological fields, similar to the existing  [ecmwf-api-client](https://github.com/ecmwf/ecmwf-api-client) Python package.

A collection of Jupyter Notebooks that make use of that package is available [here](https://github.com/ecmwf/notebook-examples/tree/master/opencharts).

## Installation

The `ecmwf-opendata` Python package can be installed from PyPI with:

```$ pip install ecmwf-opendata```

## Usage
The example below will download the latest available 10-day forecast for the *mean sea level pressure* (`msl`) into a local file called `data.grib2`:

```python
from ecmwf.opendata import Client

client = Client()

client.retrieve(
    step=240,
    type="fc",
    param="msl",
    target="data.grib2",
)
```

> ❗ **NOTE:** This package is designed for users that want to download a subset of the whole dataset. If you plan to download a large percentage of each data file, it may be more efficient to download whole files and filter out the data you want locally. See the documentation on the [file naming convention](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/DAC/ECMWF+open+data%3A+real-time+forecasts+from+IFS+and+AIFS) for more information. Alternatively, you can use this tool to download whole files by only specifying `date`, `time`, `step`, `stream` and `type`. Please be aware that all data for a full day is in the order of 726 GiB.


## Options

The constructor of the client object takes the following options:

```python
client = Client(
    source="ecmwf",
    model="ifs",
    resol="0p25",
    preserve_request_order=False,
    infer_stream_keyword=True,
)
```

where:

- `source` is either the name of server to contact or a fully qualified URL. Possible values are `ecmwf` to access ECMWF's servers, or `azure` to access data hosted on Microsoft's Azure. Default is `ecmwf`.

- `model` is the name of the model that produced the data. Use `ifs` for the physics-driven model, `aifs-single` for the data-driven model, and `aifs-ens` for the ensemble data-driven model. Default is `ifs`.

- `resol` specifies the resolution of the data. Default is `0p25` for 0.25 degree resolution, and is the only resolution that is currently available.

- `preserve_request_order`. If this flag is set to `True`, the library will attempt to write the retrieved data into the target file in the order specified by the request. For example, if the request specifies `param=[2t,msl]` the library will ensure that the field `2t` is first in the target file, while with `param=[msl,2t]`, the field `msl` will be first. This also works across different keywords: `...,levelist=[500,100],param=[z,t],...` will produce different output to `...,param=[z,t],levelist=[500,100],...`
If the flag is set to `False`, the library will sort the request to minimise the number of HTTP requests made to the server, leading to faster download speeds. Default is `False`.

- `infer_stream_keyword`. The `stream` keyword represents the ECMWF forecasting system that creates the data. Setting it properly requires knowledge of how ECMWF runs its operations. If this boolean is set to `True`, the library will try to infer the correct value for the `stream` keyword based on the rest of the request. Default is `True` if model is `ifs`.

 > ⚠️ **NOTE:** It is recommended **not** to set the `preserve_request_order` flag to `True` when downloading a large number of fields as this will add extra load on the servers.

## Methods

> `Client.retrieve()`

The `Client.retrieve()` method takes request as input and will retrieve the corresponding data from the server and write them in the user's target file.

A request is a list of keyword/value pairs used to select the desired data. It is possible to specify a list of values for a given keyword.

The request can either be specified as a dictionary:

```python
from ecmwf.opendata import Client

client = Client(source="ecmwf")

request = {
    "time": 0,
    "type": "fc",
    "step": 24,
    "param": ["2t", "msl"],
}

client.retrieve(request, "data.grib2")

# or:

client.retrieve(
    request=request,
    target="data.grib2",
)
```

or directly as arguments to the `retrieve()` method:

```python
from ecmwf.opendata import Client

client = Client(source="ecmwf")

client.retrieve(
    time=0,
    type="fc",
    step=24,
    param=["2t", "msl"],
    target="data.grib2",
)
```

The `date` and `time` keyword are used to select the date and time of the forecast run (see [Date and time](#date-and-time) below). If `date` or both `date` and `time` are not specified, the library will query the server for the most recent matching data. The `date` and `time` of the downloaded forecast is returned by the `retrieve()` method.

```python
from ecmwf.opendata import Client

client = Client(source="ecmwf")

result = client.retrieve(
    type="fc",
    step=24,
    param=["2t", "msl"],
    target="data.grib2",
)

print(result.datetime)
```

may print `2022-01-23 00:00:00`.

> `Client.download()`

The `Client.download()` method takes the same parameters as the `Client.retrieve()` method, but will download the whole data files from the server, ignoring keywords like `param`, `levelist` or `number`.

The example below will download all field from the latest time step 24, ignoring the keyword `param`:

```python
from ecmwf.opendata import Client

client = Client(source="ecmwf")

client.download(
    param="msl",
    type="fc",
    step=24,
    target="data.grib2",
)

```

> `Client.latest()`

The `Client.latest()` method takes the same parameters as the `Client.retrieve()` method, and returns the date of the most recent matching forecast without downloading the data:

```python
from ecmwf.opendata import Client

client = Client(source="ecmwf")

print(client.latest(
    type="fc",
    step=24,
    param=["2t", "msl"],
    target="data.grib2",
))
```

may print `2022-01-23 00:00:00`.

> ⏰ **NOTE**: The data is available between 7 and 9 hours after the forecast starting date and time, depending on the forecasting system and the time step specified.

## Request keywords

The supported keywords are:

- `type`: the type of data (compulsory, defaults to `fc`).
- `stream`: the forecast system (optional if unambiguous, compulsory otherwise). See the `infer_stream_keyword` [above](#options).
- `date`: the date at which the forecast starts.
- `time`: the time at which the forecast starts.
- `step`: the forecast time step in hours, or `fcmonth`, the time step in months for the seasonal forecast (compulsory, default to `0` and `1`, respectively).

and (all optional, with no defaults):

- `param`: the meteorological parameters, such as wind, pressure or humidity.
- `levtype`: select between single level parameters and parameters on pressure levels.
- `levelist`: the list of pressure levels when relevant.
- `number`: the list of ensemble member numbers when relevant.

The keywords in the first list are used to identify which file to access, while the second list is used to identify which parts of the files need to be actually downloaded. Some HTTP servers are able to return multiple parts of a file, while other can only return a single part from a file. In the latter case, the library may perform many HTTP requests to the server. If you wish to download whole files, only provide keywords from the first list.

### Date and time

The date and time parameters refer to the starting time of the forecast. All date and time are expressed in UTC.

There are several ways to specify the date and time in a request.

Date can be specified using strings, numbers and Python `datetime.datetime` or `datetime.date` objects:

```python
...
    date='20220125',
    time=12,
...
    date='2022-01-25',
    time=12,
...
    date='2022-01-25 12:00:00',
...
    date=20220125,
    time=12,
...
    date=datetime.datetime(2022, 1, 25, 12, 0, 0),
...
    date=datetime.date(2022, 1, 25),
    time=12,
...
```

Dates can also be given as a number less than or equal to zero. In this case, it is equivalent to the current UTC date minus the given number of days:

```python
...
    date=0, # today
    date=-1, # yesterday
    date=-2, # the day before yesterday
...
```

The keyword `time` can be given as a string or an integer, or a Python `datetime.time` object. All values of time below are equivalent:

```python
...
    time=12,
...
    time=1200,
...
    time='12',
...
    time='1200',
...
    time=datetime.time(12),
...
```

| List of valid values for time |
| ----------------------------- |
| 0, 6, 12 and 18 |

If `time` is not specified, the time is extracted from the date.

```python
...
   date='2022-01-25 12:00:00',
...
```

is equivalent to:

```python
...
   date='2022-01-25',
   time=12,
...
```

If the `time` keyword is specified, it overrides any time given in the request.

```python
...
   date='2022-01-25 12:00:00',
   time=18,
...
```

is equivalent to:

```python
...
   date='2022-01-25',
   time=18,
...
```

As stated before, if `date` or both `date` and `time` are not specified, the library will query the server for the most recent matching data. The `date` and `time` of the downloaded forecast is returned by the `retrieve()` method:

Example without the `date` keyword:

```python
from ecmwf.opendata import Client

client = Client(source="ecmwf")

result = client.retrieve(
    time=12,
    type="fc",
    param="2t",
    step="24",
    target="data.grib2",
)

print(result.datetime)

```

will print `2022-01-22 12:00:00` if run in the morning of 2022-01-23.

Example without the `date` and `time` keywords:

```python
from ecmwf.opendata import Client

client = Client(source="ecmwf")

result = client.retrieve(
    type="fc",
    param="2t",
    step="24",
    target="data.grib2",
)

print(result.datetime)

```

will print `2022-01-23 00:00:00` if run in the morning of 2022-01-23.

### Stream and type

ECMWF runs several forecasting systems:

- [HRES](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/FUG/HRES+-+High-Resolution+Forecast): High Resolution Forecast.
- [ENS](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/FUG/ENS+-+Ensemble+Forecasts): Ensemble Forecasts.
- [SEAS](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/FUG/Long-Range+%28Seasonal%29+Forecast): Long-Range (Seasonal) Forecast.

Each of these forecasts also produces several types of products, that are referred to using the keywords
`stream` and `type`.

> Valid values for `type` are:

HRES:

- `fc`: Forecast.

ENS:

- `cf`: Control forecast.
- `pf`: Perturbed forecast.
- `em`: Ensemble mean.
- `es`: Ensemble standard deviation.
- `ep`: Probabilities.

> Valid values for `stream` are:

- `oper`: Atmospheric fields from HRES - 00 UTC and 12 UTC.
- `wave`: Ocean wave fields from HRES - 00 UTC and 12 UTC.
- `enfo`: Atmospheric fields from ENS.
- `waef`: Ocean wave fields from ENS.
- `scda`: Atmospheric fields from HRES - 06 UTC and 18 UTC.
- `scwv`: Ocean wave fields from HRES - 06 UTC and 18 UTC.

> 📌 **NOTE**: if the client's flag [`infer_stream_keyword`](#options) is set to `True`, the library will infer the stream from the `type` and `time`. In that case, you just need to specify `stream=wave` to access ocean wave products, and don't provide a value for `stream` in other cases.

### Time steps

To select a time step, use the `step` keyword:

```python
...
   step=24,
...
   step=[24, 48],
...
```

| Forecasting system | Time | List of time steps |
| -------- | ---- | ------------------ |
| HRES | 00 and 12 | 0 to 144 by 3, 144 to 240 by 6 |
| ENS | 00 and 12 | 0 to 144 by 3, 144 to 360 by 6 |
| HRES | 06 and 18 | 0 to 90 by 3 |
| ENS | 06 and 18 | 0 to 144 by 3 |
| Probabilities - Instantaneous weather events | 00 and 12 | 0 to 360 by 12 |
| Probabilities - Daily weather events | 00 and 12 | 0-24 to 336-360 by 12 |

> 📌 **NOTE**: Not specifying `step` will return all available time steps.

### Parameters and levels

To select a parameter, use the `param` keyword:

```python
...
   param="msl",
...
   param=["2t", "msl"]
...
```

for pressure level parameters, use the `levelist` keyword:

```python
...
   param="t",
   levelist=850,
...
   param=["u", "v"],
   levelist=[1000, 850, 500],
...
```

> 📌 **NOTE**: Not specifying `levelist` will return all available levels, and not specifying `param` will return all available parameters.
